# MS Project - ANALYSIS OF VMWARE ESXI AND VCENTER LOGS
Goal of this project is to parse log files generated by my home lab into human readable format for useful analytics. These analytics will be used for troubleshooting issues which arise or for insights into what needs to be done to improve performance of the cluster.
# Approach
The approach of the solution proposed by this project was to convert the unstructured dataset which is in the form of log bundles obtained from the hosts in the homelab into an organized data structure so that we can work on the data and analyze it.
To do so, we have employed the use of inbuilt string functions which come pre-packaged with python to parse through the log files. After parsing, we stored the data into a structured data structure from the pandas packaged called DataFrame. 
Finally, we make use of the unbuilt functions included with pandas and another visualization package called matplotlib to get our results.
